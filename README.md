> [!NOTE]
> This transpiler converts your **WHOLE** Typescript project to Javascript:
<br/>
> Eg. If your homie doesn't know Typescript, don't go removing types file by file by yourself manually or use tools which removes types from the code you copy and paste into the tool, don't be an old hag, just download and use super-detype to remove types automatically from your whole project without any issues. 


### How to Install

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Its crucial to install it globally, so that you can use it from any directory of terminal** 

* In your terminal
```
npm i -g super-detype
```
* If you do not wish to install it, then just
```
npx super-detype "<typescript-project-directory>" "<output-directory>"
```
<br/>

> [!TIP]
### How to Use
* In your terminal
* It's Recommended to wrap the path with "quotes" to select folders with spaces

```
super-detype "<typescript-project-directory>" "<output-directory>"
```
<br/>

> [!TIP]
* First arguement: should be the path of your typescript project's directory which you want to convert
* Second arguement: should be the path of destination where you want to save your converted project
